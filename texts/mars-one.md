Mars One is a project that wants to put humans on Mars by 2024. It is a private organization with headquarters in the Netherlands. 
By 2035 Mars a human colony of 24 people will live permanently on Mars.

The mission calls for the launch of unmanned spacecraft that will bring the necessary equipment, living units and survival gear to 
Mars as soon as 2020. Starting in 2024, the first four people will start their seven month journey to the red planet. In the following 
years five more groups of colonists will fly to Mars.

The project was first announced in 2011 by the head of the mission Bas Lansdorp. He claims that over 200,000 people from around the 
world were interested in the project. Mars One selected a first pool of possible candidates in 2013 and have narrowed the number down to 
a hundred. In 2015 the final 24 people will be chosen and split into six teams of four who will be sent to the red planet.

Mars One is a one-way trip that, according to the Dutch organization, will cost around 6 billion dollars, much less than any NASA project 
to put a man on Mars. The project is to be funded by donations from around the world but most of the money is expected to come from a media 
group that will broadcast the whole mission to Earth.

The Mars One project has led to a lot of controversy and criticism. Space experts say it is not possible to set up and carry out such a mission 
within a decade. They also claim that the amount of money for such a mission is far too low. Few experts think that the project will ever get 
off the Earthâ€™s surface.

Those who support the project claim, however, that the Mars One expedition is historic and can be compared to the first climbing of Mount Everest 
or the first expedition to the South Pole.

The people chosen to fly to Mars will need certain qualifications and undergo seven years of training. They must be skilled at repairing things, 
growing their own food and also have medical training. Scientists, however, think that once humans land on Mars they will only be able to survive for a few months.

There are other serious challenges that Mars One colonists face, including physical and psychological problems on their journey. In addition, Mars 
has no magnetic field, which means the people who go there will face high radiation levels.

The young project has recently encountered some problems. Currently, the project organizers are looking for companies that can meet the deadlines 
and supply the spacecraft and equipment needed for the journey.
